## Solo, You're All Set! 🎯

Your portfolio now clearly distinguishes between:
- The infrastructure you built
- The AI agent that uses it autonomously
- The web platform that provides human access
- The public-facing agent suite

Everything is optimized, professional, and ready to impress the Erasmus Mundus selection committee. The technical depth is there, the research impact is clear, and the presentation is polished.

**You've got this!** 🚀

Best regards,
